                What is Trackify:
            </h4>
            <p>
                Trackify is a simple web application that is meant to do only one thing: Act as a hub to compile bits of information you find from various sources on the internet. The reason this can boost your productivity is that only when you rememeber information can you actually apply it in real life. Just reading information, and not noting it down somewhere or going back to it later will simply cause you to forget it after a much less time period than you think. Hence it is always a good idea to keep track of these information bits in a way that you can come back to them later.

            <h4>
                Kinds of information you can store on Trackify:
            </h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Articles: Came across an interesting article, but have no time to read at the moment? Save the article on Trackify and read whenever you want! Trackify also gives you the option to conveniently highlight the text in the article that you think resonates with you. So you may never have to go back to the article again since the key bits from the articles will be stored separately.</li>
                    <li>Podcasts: whenever listening to podcasts, you can convert a certain part of the audio into an "audio-highlight" with our speech to text convertor.</li>
                    <li>Books: It is more than a coincidence that most successful people are avid readers. store your favourite parts from the self-help books you read in our "books" section so that you have the knowledge of every book evrywhere you go, but without having to carry a physical copy everywhere. Always remember, a moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory. You might have to type your paragraphs initially, but that information is here to stay forever.</li>
                    <li>Videos: paste links of your favourite videos and we will save them for you so that you can keep track of the best content.</li>
